Please read and internalize the full summary in the log file from the previous strategic session (the last entry prepended by a date in this file). Your objectives are to:

	•	Reconstruct the strategic context and trajectory from that document,
	•	Identify key decisions, unresolved questions, emerging opportunities, and stakeholder dynamics,
	•	Prepare to help move the strategy forward in this session.

Once reviewed, respond with:

1. Strategic Recap (max 200 words)
	•	Summarize the current state of the strategy based on the prior session, including momentum, blocks, and next inflection points.

2. Confidence Check
	•	End your recap with: “Would you like me to expand or adjust any part of that recap?”

3. Intentional Launch
Ask:
“Would you like to begin with a brain dump (freeform idea capture) or have me propose structured starting points based on prior context?”

If the user chooses brain dump:
	•	Open with: “Drop anything on your mind—I’ll sort, tag, and synthesize after.”

If the user chooses starting points:
Generate a modular list of prompts, grouped under:
	•	Exploration Prompts (e.g., new directions, assumptions to test)
	•	Operational Triggers (e.g., missed actions, incomplete loops)
	•	Relationship Leverage Points (e.g., follow-ups, partner engagement, trust building)

Each item should be written as a concise question or action prompt to stimulate momentum.

While doing the above, any content that's been drafted should be written to a separate canvas.

2. Decisions & Strategic Outcomes
• A prioritized action sequence was agreed upon, highlighting the need to:
    1. Finalize governance documents and Sovereign AI pitch materials.
    2. Update and send memos to Finance and Foreign Affairs Ministries.
    3. Draft MOUs for private industry partners.
    4. Develop public-facing infrastructure (URLs, website).

• Premature outreach to ministries without aligned messaging could lead to mixed signals.

Leverage Points:
• Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs memos are strategic levers to cascade broader government buy-in.

5. Partnerships & Outreach
• Private sector partners discussed for upcoming MOUs: Nova.is, Landsspitali, RUV, Islandsbanki, Island.is.
• Ministries in play: Finance (MOU/Memo), Foreign Affairs (Memo), Education (ongoing alignment via Thordis).
• Next steps include crafting sector-specific MOUs and syncing timing with memos to Ministries.

6. Unresolved Items / Questions for Next Session
• What messaging or legal structuring is required for Foreign Affairs engagement?
• How should timing be coordinated between public launch (website) and MOU signings?
• Final due date for Thordis’s long-term contract prep is TBD.

7. Contextual Integration
• This session built directly on prior strategic mapping, particularly regarding stakeholder sequencing, ministry alignment, and public-private roadmap formation.
• Previously identified priorities (e.g., governance, pre-prompting, PR timing) were reaffirmed and integrated.
• Laura at LEX and Anthropic MOU tracks are assumed to continue in parallel and were not re-prioritized here, though still crucial.
